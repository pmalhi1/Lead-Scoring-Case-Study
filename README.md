# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Objective:
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well.
